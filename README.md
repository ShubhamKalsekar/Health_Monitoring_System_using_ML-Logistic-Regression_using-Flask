# health_monitoring-_System_using_ML-LR_
To implement the proposed real-time health monitoring system, a cloud network model was developed using the ThingSpeak platform, which offers a convenient infrastructure for data collection, storage, and analysis. The system leverages machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, to train the model on the dataset that shows the prediction of taking consultation of Doctor based on the values of parameters of collected data .In the subsequent sections, we will discuss the  dataset used, parameter tuning for the machine learning algorithms, and the evaluation results of the cloud network model. These findings will shed light on the performance and effectiveness of the system in accurately predicting the necessity of medical consultation based on vital sign analysis.
